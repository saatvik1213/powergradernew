#### SODA Hackathon Proof of Concept
#### Project: PowerGrader
#### Team: SSGA
#### Date: October 26th, 2024
#### Team Members: Gonzalo Allendes, Saatvik Choudhary, Anadi Dewan, Swayam Mehda
#### Chosen Track: SODA: Develop software that can scale and improve accessibility to education.

## Overview

### Project Description:

    PowerGrader is a web application for automated grading in written assignments submitted 
    to online educational platforms. With the rise of online learning and the widespread use 
    of online course management systems, there is an increasing need for providing the
    functionality to assess students' learning automatically. Nowadays, available tools 
    provide support for multiple choice exams or embedded coding, but they do not support
    automated grading for written submissions. While universities may benefit from freeing
    educators to focus on high-impact teaching, free online courses may benefit from an 
    automated grader like PowerGrader to offer the course administrator the option to 
    request written assignments from students. 

    The implementation of automated grading for written submissions represents a significant 
    advancement in online education, paving the way for its large scale application in 
    university courses. This shift could lead to improved cost efficiency in grading tasks,
    allowing educators to allocate more time to instructional activities and student 
    engagement.

## Project Plan

### Key Requirements:

| **Requirement**              | **Description**                                                                                              |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **User Authentication**      | Course administrators, students, and graders must be able to log in to the platform.                         |
| **Assignment Submission**    | Students should be able to submit written assignments in various formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX).                  |
| **Automated Grading Engine** | The application must implement an AI-powered algorithm to grade assignments.                                 |
| **Normal Distribution**      | The algorithm should apply a grading curve after processing all submissions.                                                      |
| **Feedback Mechanism**       | Users should receive automated feedback based on grading criteria, including suggestions for improvement.    |
| **Customizable Rubrics**     | Instructors should be able to define specific grading rubrics and criteria for different assignments.        |
| **Analytics Dashboard**      | Provide an interface for instructors to view analytics on student performance and assignment submissions.    |

#### Physical ER Diagram

The physical ER diagram details the actual implementation of our database system, showing specific tables, columns,
data types, and relationships.

### Implementation

#### Tech Stack

> **Next.js**: This project was created with the Next.JS React framework for building full-stack applications.
>
> **PostgreSQL**: This project uses PostgreSQL to integrate a database that manages user roles and submission,
> information, along with grades and paths to the stored files.
> 
> **Firebase**: Firebase serves as the file storage system for assignment submissions.
> 
> **Next-auth**: We utilize NextAuth to enable secure session management, supporting Google authentication.
> 
> **Gemini**: This project integrates Googleâ€™s Generative AI framework, Gemini, to analyze files 
> and generate responses based on a grading rubric.
> 
> **Flask**: Flask is integrated into the project to facilitate API calls to the database.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
